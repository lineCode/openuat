Version 0.10, released

  This is a minor new feature release, adding support for new accelerometer
  sensors available on some recent laptop mainboards and Bluetooth RFCOMM
  communication. It is also the first release to include J2ME applets with
  automatic building from the standard build.xml.
  A new concept introduced with this release is the concept of roles: a device
  or side of the authentication can hold one or multiple roles. Initial
  implementations include the two sides of the Resurrecting Duckling protocol.
  
  New interfaces:
  
  New abstraction: roles:
  * roles.Duckling
  * roles.MotherDuck
  
  New sensor data classes:
  * sensors.MainboardAccelerometerReaderFactory with implementations for 
    Linux and MacOS/X
  
  New utility classes for communication:
  * util.BluetoothRFCOMMServer
  * util.BluetoothPeerManager
  * util.BluetoothSupport with support for the avetanaBT stack
  
  New utility classes for user interaction:
  * apps.util.TrayIconHelper
  
  Moved communication classes from org.openuat.authentication and
  org.openuat.sensors to org.openuat.util:
  * SafetyBeltTimer
  * MessageListener
  * UDPMulticastSocket
  * HostServerSocket
  * BluetoothRFCOMMChannel
  
  New applications:
  * (J2ME) apps.j2me.HelloProporty

Version 0.9, released 2007-01-18

  This is a major new features release, adding infrastructure for dealing with
  time series data on resource limited devices and a new context 
  authentication protocol based on accelerometers. This release also uses a 
  new package hierarchy: org.openuat.

  New interfaces:
  * sensors.SamplesSink
  * sensors.SegmentsSink

  New basic protocols:
  * authentication.CandidateKeyProtocol
  * authentication.CKPOverUDP

  New context authentication protocols:
  * authentication.accelerometers.MotionAuthenticationProtocol1
  * authentication.accelerometers.MotionAuthenticationProtocol2

  Sensor data classes:
  * sensors.AsciiLineReaderBase with two example subclasses
  * sensors.TimeSeries
  * sensors.TimeSeriesAggregator
  * features.Coherence
  * features.FFT
  * features.Quantizer
  * features.QuantizedFFTCoefficients

  New utility classes:
  * authentication.UDPMulticastSocket
  * sensors.BluetoothRFCOMMChannel
  * features.Complex
  * features.TimeSeriesUtil

  New applications:
  * apps.ShakingSinglePCDemonstrator

Version 0.8, released 2006-12-04

  This is the first public release and includes basic infrastructure classes,
  interfaces for event-based authentication protocols, and a first 
  implementation for spatial authentication based on ultrasound pulses. The
  code currently uses the Java package hierarchie under 
  org.eu.mayrhofer.authentication.

  Interfaces:
  * authentication.AuthenticationProgressHandler
  * authentication.MessageListener
  * channel.SecureChannel
  * channel.IPSecConnection

  Low-level crpytographic primitives:
  * util.Hash
  * included, select Bouncycastle classes for J2ME support

  Basic protocols:
  * authentication.SimpleKeyAgreement
  * authentication.InterlockProtocol
  * authentication.DHOverTCPWithVerification
  * channel.IPSecConnection_Factory

  Context authentication protocols:
  * authentication.relate.RelateAuthenticationProtocol

  Utility classes:
  * authentication.SafetyBeltTimer
  * authentication.AuthenticationEventSender
  * authentication.HostServerSocket
  * channel.Helper
  * channel.Command
  * channel.X509CertificateGenerator
  * apps.BinaryBlockStreamer

  Applications:
  * apps.IPSecConnectorAdmin
  * apps.IPSecConnectorClient
