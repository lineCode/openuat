During the development of group communication the TGDH protocol-set was found useful.

This protocol-set is implemented by Lijun Liao. After requesting the source code this email was sent to us.

You can find the source code under
http://nds.hgi.rub.de/liao/works/TGDH-Source.zip. This API implements the original TGDH and was completed 
five years ago for my student project.

Best regards,

After several attempts to contact Mr. Liao to get a clearance for usage of the source, decided was to use
the public compiled classes that are available at: http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/nds/forschung/gebiete/tgdh/ 

The source is stored in:
/thirdparty/tgdh/core
/thirdparty/tgdh/demo
/thirdparty/tgdh/test

The compiled classes for public usage:
