Additional methods that should be implemented within OpenUAT:
- "A Gesture-based Authentication Scheme for Untrusted Public Terminals" 
  to authenticate a user interface device to a personal mobile device.
- Seeing-is-Believing and extension
- Loud-and-Clear and HAPADEP
- Amigo
- Infrared

---------------------------
future Changelog:

  A new concept introduced with this release is the concept of roles: a device
  or side of the authentication can hold one or multiple roles. Initial
  implementations include the two sides of the Resurrecting Duckling protocol.

  New abstraction: roles:
  * roles.Duckling
  * roles.MotherDuck
