After unpacking the OpenUAT source tree, compiling and running the unit tests 
can be done by simply calling

	ant

This assumes an installed ant version >= 1.6 and a Java development kit
installed in the runtime path. Although the ant script detects which version
(1.4, 1.5, or 1.6) is installed, the respective newest version is recommended
so that all classes can be compiled. When running ant under an older JDK
version, some classes will be excluded from compilation and thus from testing.

To successfully run the JUnit tests, the installed Java runtime environment
needs to be able to use AES with 256 Bit keys. The default Sun JRE does not
allow this key strength unless the "JCE Unlimited Strength" policy is 
installed. When unit tests fail (e.g. org.openuat.authentication.test.
InterlockProtocolTest), please check that this policy has been correctly 
installed, effectively replacing local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar in 
the lib/security directory of the JRE.

J2ME
----
Most of the code in OpenUAT can be compiled for use in J2ME, e.g. on mobile
phones. To compile it, the "Wireless Toolkit" (WTK) >= 2.2 and J2MEPolish
version 2 need to be installed. The installation path of J2MEPolish should be
put into the "polish.home" variable in "build.xml". If everything has been
installed and set, the ant build script should detect the J2ME build 
environment and use it:

     [echo]     WTK with MIDP2.0 and CLDC1.1: true
