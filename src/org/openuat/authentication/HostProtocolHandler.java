/** This class handles the key agreement protocol between two hosts on a stream
 * level. It implements both sides of the protocol, allowing to handle incoming
 * connections (i.e. incoming authentication requests) as well as initiating
 * outgoing connections (i.e. outgoing authentication requests). Events are
 * raised upon authentication success, failure and during the progress of an
 * authentication protocol. <br>
 * 
 * The protocol is called UACAP (unified auxiliary channel authentication 
 * protocol) and is based on the MANA IV family of multi-channel authentication
 * protocols as specified in [Sven Laur and Kaisa Nyberg: "EfÔ¨Åcient Mutual Data 
 * Authentication Using Manually Authenticated Strings: Extended Version"],
 * specifically the MA-DH variant. However, it additionally implements an
 * optional commitment-based exchange instead of just producing an out-of-band
 * message from the key material for the <b>input</b> type authentication as
 * explained below. This optional exchange is based on the MANA III protocol
 * presented earlier and a variant proposed by Wong and Stajano. <br>
 * 
 * This class has a dual interface and can thus be used in two different ways: 
 * either by driving the steps in the protocol from an outside caller on the 
 * instantiated object (henceforth referred to as the PlainObject style) or by 
 * registering an out-of-band channel that is subsequently used by 
 * HostProtocolHandler to handle the complete protocol run (hanceforth referred 
 * to as the Hollywood style, cf. http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HollywoodPrinciple). 
 * The PlainObject style is more flexible, as all steps "outside" the basic 
 * crypto protocol can be handled in any way, and is used by instantiating the 
 * object with the "basic" constructor.
 * The Hollywood style can be easier to use, making the whole authentication
 * protocol a black box by reducing it to a single method call, and can be used
 * when an object implementing the OOBChannel interface is conveniently
 * available. In this case, instantiate the object by passing the 
 * AuxiliaryChannel object to the constructor.
 * In both cases, the object will fire usual authentication events for any 
 * outside listener. <br>
 * 
 * TODO: This explanation needs to be updated to actually be true...
 * 
 * The simplest possible case to use the ManaIV class for authentication is to
 * instantiate it, Hollywood style, with an existing OOBChannel object and to 
 * let it run the key agreement:
 * <pre>
 * ManaIV m = new ManaIV(myOobChannel, true);
 * m.addAuthenticationProgressHandler(myself);
 * m.authenticate(); // this method returns immediately
 * // ... wait for AuthenticationSuccess event and use the embedded key 
 * </pre>
 * Alternatively, it may e.g. be used for the heavy crypto lifting, but 
 * out-of-band message transfer is handled in a custom way, PlainObject style:
 * ManaIV m1 = new ManaIV(true);
 * byte[] msg = m1.getOobMessage();
 * // transfer msg to the remote side in a secure way
 * // on the other side:
 * m2.addOobMessage(msg);
 * 
 * The authentication success event generated by this protocol will return a 
 * RemoteConnection object for the remote parameter and an Object array as the 
 * result parameter. This object array will always have at least 3 objects: two 
 * byte arrays representing the session key and the out-of-band message for
 * <b>transfer</b> or <b>comparison</b> verification, and a String representing
 * the optional parameter that might have been specified by the client or which 
 * might have been passed to the protocol when in client mode. This third 
 * object in the object array can be null if no parameter was specified, but it 
 * will always be there. For <b>input</b> type authentication, the second 
 * object (the out-of-band message) will be null because authentication will
 * have already happened at this stage. For the other two types, the first 
 * object (the session key) may only be used <b>after</b> successful (mutual)
 * verification of the out-of-band message.
 * An optional fourth object will be included with the array when the 
 * keepSocketConnected flag was set. This fourth paramater will then contain 
 * the still connected channel object. <br>
 * 
 * If, in addition to UACAP, the server part of this HostProtocolHandler 
 * should support other commands, then custom handlers can be registered with 
 * addProtocolCommandHandlers. These commands can subsequently be handled at 
 * the stage when the Protocol_AuthenticationRequest command would be expected.
 * 
 * TODO: signal to event listeners if the other side has been human-verified
 * (in case of unidirectional OOB channels) 
 * 
 * TODO: rename out-of-band to auxiliary channel
 * 
 * @author Rene Mayrhofer
 * @version 2.0, changes to 1.0: The performProtocol method has been 
 *               significantly improved and is now based upon a generalized
 *               MA-DH protocol (which includes at least one additional
 * 				 commitment message but may add more) instead of simple and
 * 				 potentially (depending on future uses of this class) insecure
 *  			 Diffie-Hellman-only key exchange.
 * @version 1.1, changes to 1.0: Support registering additional protocol 
 *               handlers that are called for their registered protocol.

	/** This method implements the simplest possible commitment scheme for

	 * Mana IV article:
	 * 
	 * Practical implementations [ZJC06,WUS06] of the MA‚ÄìDH protocol use 
	 * c = H(g^a) and such a relaxed security proof would bridge the gap 
	 * between theory and practice.
	 * 
	 * The current implementation uses SHA256-double for the commitment.
     *
     * Other options for implementing the commitment scheme according to the
     * Mana IV article are:
     * 
     * In reality, a cryptographic hash functions like SHA-1 are used instead 
     * of commitments, as such constructions are hundred times faster and there 
     * are no setup assumptions. Let H be a collision resistant hash function. 
     * Then the hash commitment is computed as (c, d) := Com(x, r) with 
     * c = H(x||r) and d = (x, r) or, as in HMAC, c = H(r ‚äï opad||H(r ‚äï ipad||x)) 
     * with d = r. Both constructions are a priori not hiding. We would like to 
     * have a provably secure construction. In theory, we could use one-wayness 
     * of H and define commitment with hard-core bits but this leads to large 
     * commitments. Instead, we use Bellare-Rogaway random oracle design 
     * principle to heuristically argue that a hash commitment based on the 
     * OAEP padding is a better alternative. Recall that the OAEP padding is 
     * c = H(s, t), s = (x||0^k0 ) XOR g(r), t = r XOR f(s). The corresponding
