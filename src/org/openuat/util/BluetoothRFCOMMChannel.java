The URL format for an RFCOMMStreamConnection:
btspp://hostname:[CN | UUID];parameters

   
  
Where:
btl2cap is the URL scheme for an L2CAPConnection.
btspp is the URL scheme for an RFCOMM StreamConnection.
hostname is either localhost to set up a server connection, or the Bluetooth address to create a client connection.
PSMis the Protocol/Service Multiplexer value, used by a clientconnecting to a server. This is similar in concept to a TCP/IP port.
CN is the Channel Number value, used by a client connecting to a server â€“ also similar in concept to a TCP/IP port.
UUID is the UUID value used when setting up a service on a server.
parameters include name to describe the service name, and the security parameters authenticate, authorize, and encrypt. 
*/

btspp://hostname:[CN | UUID];authenticate=true;authorize=true;encrypt=true

   
  
Where:
authenticate verifies the identity of a connecting device.
authorize verifies whether access is granted by a connecting (identified) device.
encrypt specifies that the connection must be encrypted.
You've already seen that a client wishing to connect to a service can retrieve the service's connection URL by calling the method ServiceRecord.getConnectionURL(). One of this method's arguments, requiredSecurity, specifies whether the returned connection URL should include the optional authenticate and encrypt security parameters. The valid values for requiredSecurity are: 
ServiceRecord.NOAUTHENTICATE_NOENCRYPTindicates authenticate=false; encrypt=false.
ServiceRecord.AUTHENTICATE_NOENCRYPT indicates authenticate=true; encrypt=false.
ServiceRecord.AUTHENTICATE_ENCRYPTindicates authenticate=true; encrypt=true.
