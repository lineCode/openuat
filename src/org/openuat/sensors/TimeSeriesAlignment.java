	 *                  of the input space.
	 * @param windowSize The time window size to use for detecting active/quiescent
	 *                   segments. This is specified as the number of samples in the
	 *                   window.
	 * @param minSegmentSize The minimum size of an active segment to be regarded
	 *                       significant enough to be sent to listeners.
	 * @param maxSegmentSize If set to something other than -1, specifies the
	 *                       maximum size of an active segments. If an active segment
	 *                       is longer than this number of samples, it will be sent
